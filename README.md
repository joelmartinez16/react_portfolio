#README.md


This project displays a portfolio created using react.
The portfolio has an about me section, projects section,  contact page, and a resume.


A user will be able to learn a little about myself and see some projects that I have worked on. Also, there are links to my github and linked in accounts.


Heres a link to the deployed page. https://joelmartinez16.github.io/react_portfolio/
